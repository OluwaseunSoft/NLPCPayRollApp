Your task (should you choose to accept it) is to build a payroll System that manages employee monthly
renumerations.
Use Case: Adigun & Co. Needs to manage employees' monthly renumerations (payroll system)
The company wants to be able to:
i. Create payroll structure for each employee cadre level and position. (Use your discretion to
come up with cadre level and positions.)
ii. Create components of payroll system into Earnings and Deductions
iii. Assign each payroll component for each cadre level and steps.
iv. Allow staffs to view all their earnings and deductions.
You may need to create endpoint to setup employees, cadre levels and positions, but you can also
choose to bulk create a few of those in your DB. It's more important for us to see how you manage
employee's data with their respective cadre levels and positions. You can leave comments on what you
would do to improve the system if you had more time and resources.
